I am starting an experiment to see if hyperconnections synergize well with multi token prediction objectives.  My inspiration for this comes from the intuition that hyper connections are well suited to deal with the dynamics that multi token prediction introduces.  Specifically, I hypothesize that the hyperconnections will allow certain streams and certain regions of the model to specialize in predicting certain tokens.  


## Experimental Design
I will implement a multi token prediction objective on top of a transformer model with hyperconnections.  I will compare the performance of this model a hyper connection model with a standard n=1 next token prediction model, a standard redidual model with multi token prediction, and a standard redidual model with n=1 next token prediction.  

I will also test different ways to connect the multi token prediction heads to the multi stream architecture.  I will examine feeding each stream's output to its own multi token prediction head, and also giving each head its own unqiue weighted combination of each stream, as well as the standard approach of duplicating the final stream for each prediction head.
